# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the XiaoHongShu MCP Server project. The improvements focus on enhancing code quality, reliability, performance, security, and maintainability while following established patterns for browser automation, MCP server development, and service layer architecture.

4. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL include end-to-end tests for critical user workflows
5. WHEN CI/CD pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL automatically execute all test suites and report results

### Requirement 2: Improved Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust configuration validation and management so that deployment issues are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate all environment variables using a schema validation library
2. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested fixes
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without server restart
4. WHEN multiple environments are used THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration files
5. WHEN configuration is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe configuration objects

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Security Measures

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my authentication data and operations to be secure so that my account remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cookies are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt authentication data at rest
2. WHEN user input is received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN API operations are performed THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL log security events for audit purposes
5. WHEN browser automation runs THEN the system SHALL use secure browser profiles with appropriate security settings

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and efficient operations so that I can complete tasks quickly without resource waste.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser operations are needed THEN the system SHALL reuse browser instances through connection pooling
2. WHEN multiple operations run concurrently THEN the system SHALL manage resource allocation efficiently
3. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching mechanisms
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources to prevent memory leaks
5. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and alerting capabilities

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer and operator, I want comprehensive error handling and structured logging so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured error responses with correlation IDs
2. WHEN operations are logged THEN the system SHALL use structured logging with appropriate log levels
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed context without exposing sensitive information
4. WHEN errors are handled THEN the system SHALL implement proper error recovery strategies
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL support multiple output formats (console, file, structured)

### Requirement 6: Code Quality Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code with consistent patterns so that the codebase is easy to work with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL follow consistent TypeScript patterns with comprehensive JSDoc documentation
2. WHEN magic numbers are used THEN the system SHALL replace them with named constants or configuration values
3. WHEN validation is needed THEN the system SHALL use centralized validation helpers with clear error messages
4. WHEN enums are appropriate THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript enums instead of string literals
5. WHEN async operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use proper async/await patterns with cancellation support

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Browser Automation

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable browser automation that handles edge cases gracefully so that operations complete successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser operations timeout THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent retry strategies with exponential backoff
2. WHEN selectors are used THEN the system SHALL prefer data attributes and implement fallback selector strategies
3. WHEN page interactions occur THEN the system SHALL wait for elements to be ready before interaction
4. WHEN browser resources are used THEN the system SHALL implement proper cleanup and resource management
5. WHEN browser automation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error context for troubleshooting

### Requirement 8: Operational Excellence

**User Story:** As an operator, I want monitoring, health checks, and operational tools so that I can maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
2. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL collect and expose metrics for performance monitoring
3. WHEN shutdown is requested THEN the system SHALL implement graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
4. WHEN CLI operations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive CLI tools for administration
5. WHEN system status is queried THEN the system SHALL provide detailed status information including dependencies

### Requirement 9: Enhanced MCP Protocol Support

**User Story:** As an MCP client developer, I want robust MCP protocol implementation so that integration is reliable and feature-complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP tools are called THEN the system SHALL provide consistent response formats with proper error handling
2. WHEN resources are accessed THEN the system SHALL implement efficient resource management and caching
3. WHEN protocol errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages following MCP standards
4. WHEN multiple transports are used THEN the system SHALL support both stdio and HTTP transports reliably
5. WHEN MCP capabilities are queried THEN the system SHALL accurately report available tools and resources

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and good developer experience so that I can effectively use and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria
